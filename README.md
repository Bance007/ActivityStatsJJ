Not actually created by me. Created by ChatGPT to test a Discord bot. I am a top-tier bum
This bot automatically tracks how long you spend playing games on Discord.
It watches your Discord status (when it says “Playing Valorant” or “Playing Minecraft”) and records the time. Then you can use slash commands like:

/playtime → see how much you’ve played recently or all-time

/leaderboard → compare playtime with friends in your server

/nowplaying → check what the bot is currently tracking for you

All your playtime is saved, so you can see both weekly stats and lifetime totals. It runs quietly in the background and doesn’t affect game performance.
